## Key Takeaways from the Project

### Background

*Language experience* plays an important role in theories of online sentence processing; evidence for this comes from the experimental manipulation of recent experience (e.g. syntactic priming) as well as the measurement of existing exposure to linguistic input (e.g. Langlois & Arnold, 2020; Payne et al., 2014; Mishra et al., 2012). Conceptually, "language experience" is broad, overlapping with--but not identical to--formal literacy. 
This broad scope raises challenges: *what kind* of language experience matters, *when* does it matter, and how should it be *measured*?
