## Meeting Notes

### Key Takeaways from the Project

#### Background

As information from high-credibility sources is more readily believed, by whom information is conveyed can have significant impacts on public health and safety. However, less is known about the conditions of source credibility for scientists within the emotionally and morally-charged socio-scientific domains of climate change and health science. 

#### Research Question

How do **expertise** (high vs. low) and **trustworthiness** (high vs. low) influence **perceived source credibility of scientists**?

#### Results

Results indicated that complex interactions between expertise and trustworthiness determined the perceived credibility of scientists. 

1. Expertise and trustworthiness each contributed to perceived credibility.
2. Benevolence and integrity (two different types of trustworthiness) contribute differently to perceived credibility of scientists. Namely, research integrity had a stronger effect on credibility than did benevolence.
