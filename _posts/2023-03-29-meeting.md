## Key Takeaways from the Project

### Research Question

What is the effect of source information and sourcing instructions on comprehension of multiple educational psychology texts?

### Measures

Postsecondary students were randomly assigned to one of three conditions and read abstracts of papers.
1. source + instructions: sources are given, as are instructions to pay attention to them
2. source-only: sources are given
3. no-source (control): no sources were given, only abstracts.

Dependent variables:
1. Memory for information: recall + recognition tasks (same day AND 1 week later)
2. Integration of information across texts: short essay


### Results

1. No differences were found in memory for information measures between conditions.
2. Coding of short essay responses is underway.

## Discussion

- How to code the short essay responses?
- How to measure integration?
- Are there other characteristics of the responses that would be important to measure/evaluate? (e.g. total word counts, proportion of on task vs off task content)
- Should ‘idea units’ be weighted by importance?
